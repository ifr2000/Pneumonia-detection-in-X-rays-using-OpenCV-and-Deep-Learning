# Pneumonia-detection-in-X-rays-using-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning

Objective : Pneumonia is a lung infection that affects the air sacs that is the alveoli at the end of the airways in the lungs. Detecting pneumonia can be a challenge because
of the complexities present during the interpretation stage. High expertise is required for detecting pneumonia using x-rays and takes a significant amount
of time for obtaining accurate results especially in rural and remote areas which do not have accessibility to superior diagnostic procedures. The primary objective of this study is to detect whether a patient has pneumonia by his/her/their X-ray images through the utilization of OpenCV and Deep learning. To assist and solve this incommodious problem for the radiologists by curating a deep learning model to achieve patient’s results which can be analyzed and reported to the patient directly.  Proposed is a deep learning model making use of Keras libraries and OpenCV for achieving a high test data accuracy rate.


Methodology : The proposed pneumonia detection model is a custom 
designed model which is based on “Densely Connected 
Convolutional Networks”(DenseNet) and AlexNet. 
According to DenseNet architecture it consists of blocks 
which is formed by a combination of convolution layer, 
Batch Normalization layer, and ReLU activation function. In 
DenseNet a layer is connected to all layers present after it 
this provides a strong and uniform gradient flow, better 
extraction of high-level features and also maintains low 
complexity features.
